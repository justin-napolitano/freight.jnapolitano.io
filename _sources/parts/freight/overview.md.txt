# United States Freight Overview

## Motivation

I prepared this project to better understandand US freight networks.  

## Take Aways


### Shipping

#### Cities without Major Ports

Moving goods by ship is the most energy eficient way transport freight.  I am surprised to see that the cities of Denver, Atlanta, Albuquerque, Pheonix, Tuscon, and Salt Lake are served by ports beyond their state borders.   Consquently these cities are major or regional rail hubs. 

Building critical infrastucture in these cities would be prohibitively expensive.  

An analysis of water rights in these regions would also be interesting.  Operating turbine power plants in areas that are relatively inaccessible and without access to innexpensive water may result unprofitable plants.  Solar and wind operations may be suitable replacements if freight tranport costs are factored in to the analysis. 

#### Inland Waterways

The Eastern United States' inland waterways system is heavily developed but under utilized.  The shift towards trucking and rail has diminished the importance of former canals.  Nonetheless, inland shipping is still more efficient than comparable methods of freight transport.  Budget and policy analysis should be completed to determine if federal highway subsidies cannabalize inland waterway maintainance.   

#### Important Cities

##### Chicago

The Chicago terminal is still a great marvel of the industrial era. It is a rail hub comparable to none other in the United States.  It is also a shipping hub that should be revitalized.  Inland waterways were historically less expensive than rail and trucking routes and provide greater efficency.  Unfortunately, rust belt towns no longer produce large volumes of items that require freight transport.  

##### St. Louis 

I currently know very little about this city.  There are rail connections and some ports located in this city that move primarily agricultural products to market.  I have not yet completed volumetric analysis to know whether this city is capable of handling large volumes or specialized freight.  

##### Memphis

The city of Memphis is interestingly located at the center of the US network.  Understandably FedEx centers its operations at the super hub.  Rail, ship, truck, and air routes convene at this city.  The one factor restricting the growth of this city is that the southern heading of the Mississippi requires goods to transported through the Gulf of Mexico.

##### New Orleans

The terminal city of the Mississippi delta is among the United States most important freight hubs.  Every state to its north depends upon it to ship goods through the gulf waters.  It is also important to the chemical, oil, and gas firms located near New Orleans.  

### Rail

#### Important Cities

##### Chicago

Nearly every major rail route intersects with Chicago.  The hub provides access to the  Mississippi, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.  

##### Kansas City

To access the western and northwestern United States rail must pass through Kansas City.  It is the only major rail and port facility serving the northwestern (north of Texas) sector of the United States until Portand, Oregon. 


##### St. Louis

The Chicago, ST. Louis, Kansas City route is capable of moving large freight imported from Europe or the manufactured in the North East to the midwest and northwest of the United States


##### Memphis

As the center of FedEx and the former center of the US Army Motor pool, Memphis is an important city along the Mississippi.  It serves as a transit location that can divert freight by rail to the Southwest of the United States. 

##### Denver

Denver is a growing city without many natural resources.   There are also no major ports or waterways that access city making it dependent on rail and trucking.  It is therefore unreasonably expensive to develop in the region. 


##### Salt Lake City

What can be said about Denver is also true of Salt Lake City.  Few natural resources and no water ways result in higher manufacturing and transport costs.  It is also dependent on rail and trucking.

##### Albuquerque    

Albuquerque is a rather minor transit hub but I include the station in this because it is the only option for moving goods to the region.  


##### Dallas

Dallas rail lines can move goods west towards California or South towards Houstons Ports.  It is a surpisingly important transit station that transports northern and central freight west or south towards Houston.

##### Houston

Houston is an important terminal to the Gulf of Mexico.  Freight shipped into and out of the ports can access most of the United States by rail.  Freight can also be transported by ship to states along the east coast.
