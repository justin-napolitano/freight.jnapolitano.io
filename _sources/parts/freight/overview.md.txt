# United States Freight Overview
## About

I am preparing this project to better understand rail freight in the United States.  I specifically focus on energy usage by fuel type, carbon production, and usage of freight by ton/miles.  

## Next Steps
I will continue to expand this project to include ship, rail, air, and truck freight.  I will also identify the major transit hubs, ports, and logistic networks that facillitate commerce in the United States.
